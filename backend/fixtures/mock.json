Rangers are capable of having the highest accuracy of any combat type, boasting a maximum of +234 to Ranged attack, beating both Magic with a maximum of +152, and melee with a maximum of +170 to slash. For this reason, it is often used against monsters with very high Defence. The combat triangle dictates that Rangers are strong against mages but weak against Melee fighters. The ability to attack from a distance means that a player can safespot a melee monster while fighting from safety. Keep in mind that some melee monsters have high Ranged Defence, so a high Ranged level may be needed. Crossbows are useful against monsters with high Defence, as they are very accurate.",

The house starts off with only a small room and garden, but more can be built. To build, go to the options menu, select house options, and set the build mode to on. Players will then see what looks like ghost-like Hot Spots where new objects can be built. See the Constructed items list for details on what you can build at what level.

            "description": "Runecraft (also known as Runecrafting) is a skill that allows players to craft their own runes for Magic spells. The experience earned from making runes is small, making Runecraft a very slow skill to train, on par with Slayer, and due to the need for constant running and banking, it is fairly click and attention intensive. However, due to the constant demand for different types of runes, it can create a very generous profit.",

Players must visit a Slayer master, who will assign them a task to kill certain monsters based on the player's Combat level. Slayer experience roughly equal to a slain monster's Hitpoints is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster. Many players primarily train Combat by completing Slayer tasks, as Combat experience is still given as normal while fighting Slayer monsters. Slayer is a very profitable skill to train, as high leveled slayer monsters such as slayer bosses have a multitude of both rare and valuable drops.",

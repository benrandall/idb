By levelling up Cooking the player is able to cook the more profitable foods such as lobsters, swordfish, monkfish and shark.

For this reason, it is often used against monsters with very high Defence. The combat triangle dictates that Rangers are strong against mages but weak against Melee fighters. The ability to attack from a distance means that a player can safespot a melee monster while fighting from safety.

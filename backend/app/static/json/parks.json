At first glance they dont seem that intimidating until you are right on them. If you are with small children, this will be difficult to jump. There is a low water crossing through the river but, you will need good hiking shoes or, if the weather is good, just go for a nice swim! We went when it was cold and the idea of getting wet was not even an option. We did have good boots so we did do some small river crossings without having to be miserable the rest of the trip. Nothing is worse than being wet and cold. We had our daughter with us and she was not confident about jumping the waterfall so we decided to turn around and check out the southern part of the park instead. We agreed we would go back in the summer. Beautiful trails...great park for families. I would however recommend that the trails be labeled a little better. It was a little confusing. We loved it still and cant wait to come back when we can swim in the pool near the falls.",

The water was awesome because it is just below Lake Austin Dam where the flowing water was cool and clean. Now  due to the number of people with dogs during the summer months the park smells of dog urine. The park is unsafe to swim. In addition, all of this pollution with the addition of rain washes into town lake and into downtown Austin. I love my dog but there needs to be a point at which beautiful places like this should be enjoyed by children and adults without them being worried about Bacterial Infections because of dog urine and feces. I know this review will be unpopular but it is how I feel.  This park is also one of the closest places to downtown to enjoy the water without having to pay for Barton Springs.  Finally, people complain about the poison Ivy... Well it just so happens dog urine lowers soil pH. Makes it acidic, Poison ivy loves acidic soil. If u want a dog park with water, make it past Town Lake..Stop polluting our lakes please..",

This doesnt happen often and besides that, this place is perfect. The parking is rough but it makes it so it doesnt get overcrowded. The dogs are so sweet and the owners are pretty chill. If I put on sneakers and grab a towel my yellow lab starts sobbing out of excitement because he loves this place so much.",

Early in the day it wasnt very busy, but quickly fills up.\nThe trail is rather steep.  Be sure you are confident in your strength or have hiking/walking sticks.  Its an enjoyable trail and the steep descent is part of the fun.\nDont think the Cairn stones have any purpose to guide your path.  People seem to just stack rocks.\nSculpture Falls is a pretty location.\nIts very popular.\nThe trail has a canopy over much of it from where I started.\nIn glad the day was cooler as the beginning of the trail is in the sun and is very warm when you are there later in the day.",

There is a gym with various workout equipment, a basketball court, an indoor play ground, and several rooms for exercise classes and parties.\nIn summer there is a big off leash dog area on the northwest side of the park which is fenced with lots of grass, and trees. In winter the grass gets a chance to rest and the off leash area is moved to the south end next to the community garden. This area is also fenced.

Dogs are OK, bring the leach and the pickup bag. Great place for a picnic lunch too. The crowd on top of the hill is usually thick with people taking photos and group pictures. Worth the trip. Parking is free. Great for dates, couples, families, solo runs or walks, etc. Also a great bike ride if you dont mind the steep hill assent.",

The small strip of beach was pleasant and on the day we visited.there was a stiff north wind blowing so there whitecap waves out on Puget Sound, gorgeous and a perfect view of the snow capped Olympics mountains. Later, on our way out we visited the demonstration Garden located at the park entrance which was very informative and appeared to be loaded with programs centered around Community involvement. One mark against the visit were the few dog owners that allowed their dogs to be out without leashes and I wouldnt mind seeing rules on pet restrictions on the beach enforced.",

The only downside to Carkeek is the trails can get pretty crowded on nice summer days, or on holidays even in the middle of the winter, and Ill constantly have to slow down or walk to get around large groups of families and kids.

For $30, you get one plastic cup of your drink choice and admission waived. The \"featured cocktail\" tasted like fruit water, with strawberries and mint. The bottle of red wine they were serving could be bought for $15 at the store! This is supposed to be worth $30 We were in and out in half an hour and went to a nearby restaurant instead. \n\nI have attended many wine and garden events here in Seattle and this was hands-down the worst one. The host wasnt even ready to start serving the \"cocktails\" until 20 minutes after the start time. \n\nThe plants are a sight, especially the cactus room. It would no doubt be more beautiful in the daylight but there was little light when we went. I would advise to just go during the day and avoid paying too much for an event hosted here.",

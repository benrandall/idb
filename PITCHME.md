# Self Critique

## What did we do well?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Communication
  * Divying up roles and communicating effectively allowed us to smoothly transition from phase to phase.
  * Prevented us from stepping on each other's toes
+++
### Focused concept
  * Our project concept was very narrowed down and specific, eliminating confusion for a customer and increasing ease of use 
+++
### Version control, issue tracking, Github organization
  * Maintained efficient, consistent issue tracking throughout the project
  * Peer reviewed all pull requests
  * Project boards updated constantly so everyone could be on the same page
+++
### As-we-go refactoring
  * Refactoring throughout each phase reduced the amount of refactoring we had to do at the end

---

## What did we learn?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Debugging
  * Despite having knowledge of the individual tools required for the project, we had a lot of learning to do for debugging
  * i.e. Using react dev tools, debugging in our deployment environment/docker, etc.
+++
### Plan ahead
  * Figuring out a project structure ahead of time would have been very beneficial and saved us time refactoring over and over again
  * Having a better idea of what our UI could realistically look like 
+++
### AWS instances
  * Upgrading our AWS EC2 instance was unexpected 
+++
### Leveraging 6 people
  * Six people on one project can be quite a lot, so we learned how to efficiently leverage everyone's skills
---

## What can we do better?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Loading times
  * Some react components/various pages do still have a noticeable loading time
  * Adjusted with caching, but some initial load times still noticeable +++
+++
### Increase filter & search capabilities
  * i.e. allow filtering by model type on Search results
  * Make search even more "google-like"
+++
### Pair programming & meeting up
  * Especially in person, to easily sync up on what everyone is expected to work on 
  * Face to face time can be extremely valuable in a group this large
+++
### Time management
  * We found we're all pretty good at procrastinating
+++
### UI Improvements
  * Some of our UI still looks a bit rudimentary, definitely room for improvement

---

## What puzzles us?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Designing a site with so many interconnected data points
  * Sometimes design ideas get lost in translation from conception to the screen
+++
### Mocha testing
  * We found quite a bit of difficulty writing mocha tests 
  * Sometimes they played nicely with our react components, other times not so much
+++
### Data scraping
  * Sometimes creating links between data instances gathered from an API can be a challenge

# Parkd.us Critique

## What did they do well?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Elegant UI
 * Beautifully leveraged Bootstrap 4 components
 * Site feels modern and sleek
+++
### Filtering
 * Filtering is implemented intuitively 
 * No contradicting filters
+++
### Intriguing, real world data set
 * Useful data, real world applicable
+++
### Customer communication
 * Commented on our user stories quickly
 * Asked necessary questions
 * Communicated consistently with us via Github
---

## What did we learn from them?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Flexibility & Positivity
 * Parkd.us group members stayed positive and confident when faced with adverse circumstances during the project
 * i.e. unexpected departure of group members, AWS charges, etc
+++
### Search highlighting
 * The Parkd.us group implemented this feature before us and were willing to give very useful advice on how to accomplish this
+++
### Design
 * Once again, the UI design of Parkd.us is very well done and we took some pointers from them when designing our site
---

## What can they do better?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Large images 
 * Some images on model detail pages are so large that they take up an entire viewport and require scrolling to reach more information
+++
### Categorize Food Types
 * A nice to have feature for this site would be to have the food truck data filterable on food type (i.e. Italian, Cuban, Japanese, etc)
+++
### Remove & prevent all random data
 * Sometimes, irrelevant or unrelated data will pop up in their models likely due to web scraping side effects

---

## What puzzles us about their site?
@fa[angle-down fa-2x]
+++
### Web Scraping/Data Collection
 * Parkd.us was able to effectively web scrape and hit APIs for their data, which is something that puzzled us for our project 
+++
### Quick Github API Responses
 * Their about page loads much more quickly than ours, despite having the same Github API call
+++
### Masonry
 * While the masonry grid layout looks nice, it can sometimes make search/sorting results appear in a confusing order
